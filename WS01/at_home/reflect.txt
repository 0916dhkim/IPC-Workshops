This program prints "Welcome to C Programming" enclosed within borders.
The top & bottom borders are exactly the same length, so a function to print repeating stars is written.
printStars function takes an integer argument and print stars that many times without line break.
In main function, the top border is printed which is 32 characters wide, then the main text. Finally, the bottom border is printed, and the program terminates with code 0.
