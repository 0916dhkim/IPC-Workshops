Workshop:       5 (at-home) Reflection

In this workshop I learned how to declare structs.
I also learned how to replace parallel arrays with array of structs.
Structs are similar to arrays because they both represent a contiguous
section of memory; however struct can hold data of different types while
arrays can only hold data of the same type.

Parsing user-input with a switch statement was interesting.
As long as the options are numeric, switch statement is perfectly capable
of controlling which code to be executed and also handle invalid input
by specifying the default case.

Unlike the previous workshop, array of structs were used in this workshop
instead of parallel arrays. I prefer using array of structs for two reasons.
First of all, it is more clear to see the structure of my data when I use
C-structs. Secondly, the initialization process is more concise with array
of structs. If I were to use parallel arrays, I would have needed to declare
as many arrays as the number of the fields.

Better way of declaring a struct is to declare it in a header file (".h").
If we declare a function or a struct in a ".c" file, it cannot be used
in other ".c" files. Declaring a struct in a header file allows the struct
to be used in multiple ".c" files, thus increase the re-usability.
