==============================================

Doing an outline reduces the headache during the implementation stage. If I didn't plan before
typing my solution, I would have had to do the planning and writing at the same time. Having multiple objectives
is distracting, and makes me prone to making mistakes. I feel like I am more likely to write a well-organized
code when I have a clear plan beforehand.

While-loops are the most basic iteration construct which repeats a code block "while" the condition is true.
This type of iteration is appropriate when developers do not know the number of iteration ahead of time.
I used while-loops when I was required to read user inputs because I wanted to validate user inputs
and make users enter their inputs again if they made any mistake.

For-loops are slightly more complex than while-loops, and they are often used when developers want to repeat a
code block for a certain number of times. Because I knew I had to collect temperatures of 4 days, I used
a for-loop of length 4 to collect high and low temperatures of 4 days.

For this workshop, I manually typed in example inputs and compared the output against the expected output.
I was able to catch two formatting errors (missing \n characters) by doing so. Also, gcc warned me that
I have declared `mean`, `meanHigh`, and `meanLow` variables as integers rather than floating-point types.
If I need to test more complicated I/O scenarios, I would write a file called `input.txt` and pipe it
to the compiled binary and dump the output into another text file which can be compared against
the expected output.
